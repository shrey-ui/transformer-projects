Overview
The Transformer model, introduced in the paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al., has revolutionized the field of natural language processing. This repository aims to showcase the versatility of Transformer models by providing implementations of various applications. The initial focus is on English-German translation using the WMT dataset.
